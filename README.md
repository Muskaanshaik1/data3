Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Neural Style Transfer (NST) model as part of the CODTECH IT Solutions Internship Task 3. The project leverages deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to blend the artistic style from one image (the "style image") onto the content of another image (the "content image").

The goal is to generate a new image that retains the semantic content of the original photograph while exhibiting the aesthetic qualities (colors, textures, brushstrokes) of a famous artwork.

Key Features
Neural Style Transfer: Applies artistic styles from paintings to photographs.

VGG19 Pre-trained Model: Utilizes the VGG19 network as a feature extractor to capture image content and style representations.

Content Loss & Style Loss: Implements the core loss functions for guiding the style transfer process.

Optimized Training: Uses tf.function for TensorFlow graph compilation to speed up the training loop.

Google Colab Ready: Designed for easy execution in Google Colab, leveraging free GPU resources.

How it Works
Neural Style Transfer operates by iteratively modifying a generated image to minimize two main loss components:

Content Loss: Measures how different the content of the generated image is from the original content image. This is calculated using activations from deeper layers of a pre-trained CNN (like VGG19), which capture high-level object information.

Style Loss: Measures how different the stylistic elements (textures, patterns, color schemes) of the generated image are from the style image. This is often computed using Gram matrices of activations from shallower layers of the CNN, which capture low-level texture and pattern information.

(Optional) Total Variation Loss: A regularization term that helps reduce noise and promote spatial smoothness in the generated image.

An optimization algorithm (e.g., Adam) is then used to adjust the pixels of the generated image to minimize the weighted sum of these losses, effectively "painting" the content image in the style of the artwork.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this project, you'll need:

Python 3.7+

Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab (recommended)

The following Python libraries:

tensorflow (version 2.x)

numpy

matplotlib

Pillow (PIL)

Installation
If you're using Google Colab, all necessary libraries are usually pre-installed. Just make sure to enable a GPU runtime (Runtime > Change runtime type > GPU).

If you're running locally with Jupyter Notebook:

Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
(Replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME with your actual GitHub details)

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

Bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

Bash

pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib Pillow
Running the Code
Prepare your images:

Place your chosen content image (e.g., my_content.jpg) and style image (e.g., my_style.jpg) into a dedicated folder, e.g., images/.

If using Google Colab:

Upload your images directly to the Colab session, OR

Mount your Google Drive and place images in a specific path (e.g., /content/drive/My Drive/NST_Project/images/).

If running locally: Ensure your image paths in the notebook/script correctly point to your image files.

Open the notebook:

Google Colab: Upload the [Your_Notebook_Name].ipynb file (e.g., Untitled16.ipynb) to Colab.

Local Jupyter: Start Jupyter Notebook from your project directory: jupyter notebook and open the .ipynb file.

Execute cells sequentially: Run each code cell in the notebook from top to bottom. The training process will start, and you'll see progress indicators.

View Results: After the training loop completes, the styled image will be displayed and saved as styled_image.png (or a similar name) in your session directory or specified output folder.

Examples
Here are some examples of style transfer results generated by this model, showcasing different content and style image combinations.

Content Image	Style Image	Styled Result

Export to Sheets
(Replace images/content/your_content_imageX.jpg, images/style/your_style_imageX.jpg, and results/styled_imageX.png with actual paths to your example images. You might need to create images/content, images/style, and results folders in your repository and populate them.)

Customization and Hyperparameters
The quality of the style transfer can be significantly influenced by adjusting the following parameters in the code:

style_weight: Controls the intensity of the style applied. Increase for more prominent style, decrease for subtler style.

content_weight: Controls how much the original content features are preserved. Increase for stronger content preservation, decrease if the style is not applying enough.

tv_weight: (Optional) Weight for Total Variation Loss. Increase to reduce noise and create a smoother image.

epochs and steps_per_epoch: Determines the total number of optimization iterations. More iterations can lead to better results but require more time.

content_layers and style_layers: The specific VGG19 layers used to extract content and style features. Experimenting with these can yield different results.
